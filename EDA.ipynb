In the mashed potato's I made a sauce from sour cream, butter,brown sugar, and a splash of milk. Then I blended that into the potato's.

I have a few tips though to make these sandwiches easier and healthier. For the bread, you can use any sturdy bread.  Spray one side of each slice of bread with no-stick spray before putting it on the grill. For the pesto, Classico makes a very strong jarred pesto and you only need 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of it on a sandwich, which lightens it up significantly. Sliced turkey lunch meat is easier to handle and you don't have to cook something special before hand, and thinly sliced bell peppers stay in the sandwich better. I don't usually put cheese on mine, but I put a thin slice of mozzarella on my boyfriend's turkey pesto paninis. Mozzarella is lower in fat and calories than Monterey jack.
